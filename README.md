# House-Price-Prediction-in-ML

🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts house sale prices using linear regression. Here’s what this project covers:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
🔁 Log Transformation to handle skewness
🔍 Feature Correlation Analysis
🧼 Data Preprocessing (Handling Nulls, One-Hot Encoding)
📉 Linear Regression Model with RMSE Evaluation
🧠 Model Validation & Prediction
📁 Input Files:

train.csv
test.csv
📤 Output Submission:

submission.csv (with predicted prices)
🎯 Goal: Predict house prices as accurately as possible with minimal preprocessing and a simple regression model.

"Because sometimes, all you need is a clean dataset, a good regression line, and a dream!" 😄
